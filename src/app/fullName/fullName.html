<pre>{{ fullName.person | json }}</pre>

<p>Note: The person JSON above is from the updated person and has a full name derived.
  The person JSON below is still the original person and has no full name (or an out of date one).
  The button below returns to the first state and reloads it, causing the original person to be resolved again.</p>

<!-- Passing {reload: true} results in the destination state being reloaded, and all resolve functions executed again -->
<button ui-sref="main.firstName" data-ui-sref-opts="{reload: true}">Start Over</button>
